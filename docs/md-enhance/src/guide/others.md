## GFM

If your docs both serve on documentation site and directly on GitHub, we provide a `gfm` option to align your Markdown behavior with GitHub.

::: note

Custom container is enabled by default in `@vuepress/theme-default` and `vuepress-theme-hope`, but not available in GitHub Markdown preview.
